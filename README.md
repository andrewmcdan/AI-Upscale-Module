# AI-Upscale-Module
This is a node.js module that uses [Real-ESRGAN ncnn Vulkan](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan) to upscale images. Currently at, like a beta version? ...maybe? Well, it seems to work anyways. 
See the Real-ESRGAN page for details on system requirements to run the upscaler.
